# About Me
Celeste is an ICU RN of 5 years, who recently found out that she's in love with computer programming. After facing burnout from working 12 hr shifts on the floors during these trying times, she finally decided to make a career change. Being a lifelong learner, jumping into a completely new field was actually enticing for this one. She enjoys adding new skills to her toolbelt and "I learn something new everyday," is one of her favorite sayings. <br><br>
Programming allows her to continue using that curious/solution oriented mindset every day. It also allows for "rubber-ducking" or "thinking outloud," which turned out to be a pleasant surprise for her, since this is one of her innate talents. She's excited to grow in this new field and explore some of her new skills she's currently gaining. <br><br>
